Create a public class called <b>Cube</b> without a constructor which gets one single private Integer variable <b>
Side</b>, a getter <b>GetSide()</b> and a setter <b>SetSide(int num)</b> method for this property. Actually, getter and
setter methods are not the common way to write this code in C#. In the next kata of this series, we gonna refactor the
code and make it a bit more professional...
Note: There's no need to check for negative values!
